During a BBL Sculptra procedure, our skilled practitioners at Sisu Clinic will start by marking the injection sites on your buttocks and anesthesia will be applied to reduce any discomfort. Next, the injector will use a cannula to inject the Sculptra into specific areas of your buttocks. After the injections, the treated area may be massaged to help distribute sculptra evenly. The procedure typically takes 30-45 minutes, and you can relax knowing you're on your way to a more sculpted you.\n\n**What happens after a BBL Sculptra procedure?**\n\nAfter a BBL Sculptra procedure, you're free to resume your normal activities with minimal downtime.

It is the result of tissue compression and skin elevation at the time of implanting the suture.\n\n\\- After inserting the suture, the doctor applies slight pressure on the treated area. In this way, the doctor reshapes the contours of your face and makes it visibly smoother.\n\n \n\n\\- The regenerating effect is gradual: Poly L-lactic acid (PLLA), the principal component of Silhouette Soft® is a well-known polymer that has been used for many years in a number of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications: suture thread, orthopedic pins, rods…"

Excess melanin is responsible for the darkened patches that appear on the skin’s surface, creating an uneven skin tone.\n\nHypopigmentation, is the absence of the required levels of melanin in the skin. This means that instead of darker patches on the skin, you start to see lighter skin blotches.\n\nSkin pigmentation may occur for various reasons and may be related to ageing, sun exposure, hormones and pregnancy. The formation of pigmentation on a cellular, microscopic level is complex and involves a number of processes. …"

The demand for lip enhancement has evolved over the years to include the most natural appearance possible. Dermal fillers can be used with microcannulas to give the lips a soft, full look, but LipLase offers even more benefits to men and women."

The skin is cleansed and numbed. A needle is used to make a tiny hole in the skin. Next, the microcannula is slipped under the skin and gently pulled along the tissue to deposit the filler.

Those areas then stimulate new collagen production. Fraxel targets fine lines and enlarged pores, and can address some pigmentation issues, though there are lasers that are better at eradicating more stubborn dark spots.\n\nPenetrating deep into the dermis, the micro thermal zones eliminate old, pigmented epidermal (surface) cells, creating a controlled trauma to the skin.

Patients should avoid applying makeup or other topical products to the treated area for at least 24 hours. Otherwise, patients will be able to return to their normal activities immediately after their PRP microneedling treatments.\n\nWhat Results Can I Expect from Microneedling with PRP?\n\nResults from PRP microneedling will start becoming visible within a few days to a week after the procedure. However, optimal results typically require a series of treatments spaced several weeks apart. Over time, patients will begin to see a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, a more even skin tone, and improved skin texture and elasticity. We may recommend a series of 3 to 6 treatments administered at monthly inter…"

This is typically accomplished by excising the cancer with a clean margin. The margin includes a specific amount of healthy tissue. This ensures that all cancer cells are removed, including those that may not be detectable by visual inspection. The tissue is sent to a lab for evaluation and to verify that the margin is clean. If the melanoma has spread, Dr. Hopkins may refer you to an oncologist for additional treatment.\n\nBe Healthy, Be Beautiful. Contact Hopkins Dermatology Today.\n\n_Melanoma is the most life-threatening type of skin cancer, but there is help for the condition.

Dr. Janine Hopkins, M.D., F.A.A.D., board-certified dermatologist, offers wart removal for men and women in Monroe, Alexandria, Shreveport, the Ark-La-Miss, Southlake, TX and the surrounding areas of Northeast Louisiana._\n\nWhat Are Warts?\n\nHuman papillomavirus, or HPV, has emerged as a popular topic in the media. What many people do not know, however, is that some types of HPV cause warts. The virus triggers an accelerated development of cells in the skin, and while people typically have warts on their hands and fingers, these growths can develop anywhere. Warts may be contagious, but they are also a cosmetic concern for men and women."

The effect is similar to peeling, but with minimal impact. This results in thicker, firmer skin rejuvenation. \n\n\\- For acne and acne scarring, INTRAcel™ uses radio frequency energy to reduce the production of sebum and bacteria. The RF energy helps promote the production of elastin and collagen which minimize the appearance of acne scarring. \n\nWhat can INTRAcel™ be used for??\n\n\\- The results of INTRAcel™ Microneedling treatments help the skin look smoother and younger, reducing the signs of aging by tightening the skin and improving t…"

By altering the depth of the treatment, we can tailor the treatment around each case and every skin type, meaning Co2 is suitable for a wider range of patients and indications.\n\nThe SmartXIDE works by coagulating and removing columns of skin, encouraging new, healthier skin to surface. Within treatment, collagen is also stimulated, leading to tighter and firmer skin f…"

This advanced technology creates temporary pores in the fat cells, allowing the stored fat to be released and naturally processed by the body’s lymphatic system. This results in a slimmer, more contoured appearance without the need for surgery or downtime.\n\nWhat is the Emerald Laser™ Treatment Like?\n\nDuring the Emerald Laser™ treatment, the laser is applied externally to the target area. The procedure is completely unattended, meaning it does not require constant supervision by a technician, enhancing convenience and comfort for patients. The low-level laser energy penetrates the skin and targets the fat cells without affecting the surrounding tissues. This makes the treatment safe and pain-free. The laser energy creates temporary pores in t…"

It is a common asthma medication and has a mode of action and efficacy similar to that of caffeine. In mesotherapy, it is used to promote the breakdown of fat and induce vasodilation. Aminophylline effectively inhibits phosphodiesterase, thereby increasing cAMP concentration, which allows for more efficient breakdown of fat in the cell.\n\n\\- Aminophylline has a narrow therapeutic index.

The technique is widely used and Dr. Hopkins has been using this in both practices for over 20 years to treat pre-cancers with excellent results and minimum to no complications.\n\nWhat Should I Expect from Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)?\n\nAfter the photosensitizing medications are administered topically, the pre-cancer cells absorb the medications. A special high-intensity light is applied to the treatment area to kill the cells. The procedure may also damage blood vessels that feed the pre-cancer cells. Your immune system takes over and continues to kill the pre-cancer. Dr. Hopkins monitors your progress to ensure that the pre-cancer does not return and that you do not develop new lesions in the surrounding tissues.\n\nBe Healthy, Be Beautiful.
