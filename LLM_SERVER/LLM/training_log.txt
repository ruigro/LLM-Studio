C:\1_GitHome\Local-LLM-Server\LLM\.venv\Lib\site-packages\huggingface_hub\file_download.py:143: UserWarning: `huggingface_hub` cache-system uses symlinks by default to efficiently store duplicated files but your machine does not support them in C:\hf\transformers\models--unsloth--Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-bnb-4bit. Caching files will still work but in a degraded version that might require more space on your disk. This warning can be disabled by setting the `HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING` environment variable. For more details, see https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/how-to-cache#limitations.
To support symlinks on Windows, you either need to activate Developer Mode or to run Python as an administrator. In order to activate developer mode, see this article: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development
  warnings.warn(message)
`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.
C:\1_GitHome\Local-LLM-Server\LLM\.venv\Lib\site-packages\transformers\quantizers\auto.py:239: UserWarning: You passed `quantization_config` or equivalent parameters to `from_pretrained` but the model you're loading already has a `quantization_config` attribute. The `quantization_config` from the model will be used.
