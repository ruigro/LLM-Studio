# Requirements for finetuning and running the model in this `LLM` folder
# Notes:
# - PyTorch is installed separately by SmartInstaller with correct CUDA version
# - `bitsandbytes` is optional (for 8-bit training/inference) and may require special install steps.

# NOTE: PyTorch, torchvision, torchaudio are installed by SmartInstaller
# Do NOT include them here as pip can install the wrong build (CPU-only) or the wrong version
# torch>=2.0.0  # REMOVED - SmartInstaller handles this
#
# IMPORTANT: Torch on Windows is currently not fully compatible with NumPy 2.x in all codepaths.
# Pin NumPy < 2 to avoid "Failed to initialize NumPy: _ARRAY_API not found" and similar issues.
