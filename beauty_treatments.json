The effect is similar to peeling, but with minimal impact. This results in thicker, firmer skin rejuvenation. \n\n\\- For acne and acne scarring, INTRAcel™ uses radio frequency energy to reduce the production of sebum and bacteria. The RF energy helps promote the production of elastin and collagen which minimize the appearance of acne scarring. \n\nWhat can INTRAcel™ be used for??\n\n\\- The results of INTRAcel™ Microneedling treatments help the skin look smoother and younger, reducing the signs of aging by tightening the skin and improving tone and texture.  \nINTRAcel™ has also proven to be effective in diminishing signs of acne and acne scarring, as well as reducing large unsightly pores and unwanted stretch marks. INTRAcel™ also has dramatic effects on acne and acne scarring. \n\nHow soon will I notice results?\n\n\\- After just one treatment, your skin is stimulated to produce more collagen so will start to feel smoother and tighter with visible results showing after two or more INTRAcel™ sessions. Treatments are specific to you, with one to three treatments normally being required. \n\nHow long does INTRAcel™ last?\n\n\\- Results can vary, depending on the original quality of your skin and degree of damage. Normally INTRAcel™ treatments continue to improve the skin for up to six months for plumper, glowing skin and smaller pores. \n",

    "full_content": "What is Ultherapy?\n\nUltherapy is a safe, non-surgical ultrasound treatment that counteracts the effects of time and gravity on your skin. Ultherapy uses the body's own regenerative response to gently and gradually lift skin on the eyebrow, under the chin and on the neck, and smooth lines and wrinkles on the décolletage. ​​ \n\nCan Ultherapy replace a face lift?\n\nUltherapy treats the deep foundational layer addressed in cosmetic surgery, but won't duplicate the results of a facelift. Ultherapy is a great alternative, however, especially for those not ready for surgery or for patients looking to extend the effects of cosmetic surgery. \n\nWhen will I see results? How long do they last?\n\nAfter your Ultherapy® Treatment, you may see some initial effect, but the ultimate results will take place over 2-3 months, as your body naturally regenerates collagen. Since the procedure stimulates your own collagen production, how long the results last really depends on you. The treatment produces new collagen on the inside, but your natural aging process will dictate how long that translates into visible results on the outside. \n\nIs Ultherapy safe?\n\nThe FDA-cleared Ultherapy® procedure has been used safely in over half a million treatments worldwide. Ultrasound energy has been used safely in the medical field for more than 50 years. In addition, every Ultherapy practitioner receives extensive procedural training, \n\nAre there any side effects?\n\nThe skin might appear flushed at first, but the redness should disappear within a few hours. Some patients experience slight swelling, tingling or tenderness to the touch, but these are temporary in nature. Other, less common post-procedural effects may include temporary bruising or numbness on small areas of skin. As with any medical procedure, there is the possibility for other rare effects, which your practitioner will review with you. \n\nRecently upgraded Amplify II version Ulthera\n\n\\- Less pain by half compared to previous versions\n\n\\- Improv",

    "full_content": "\\- Mesotherapy, which is the injection of substances locally into mesodermally derived subcutaneous tissue, developed from empirical observations of a French physician in the 1950s. Although popular in Europe for many medical purposes, it is used for local cosmetic fat reduction in the United States.\n\n\\- Aminophylline is a mixture of theophylline and ethylenediamine. It is a common asthma medication and has a mode of action and efficacy similar to that of caffeine. In mesotherapy, it is used to promote the breakdown of fat and induce vasodilation. Aminophylline effectively inhibits phosphodiesterase, thereby increasing cAMP concentration, which allows for more efficient breakdown of fat in the cell.\n\n\\- Aminophylline has a narrow therapeutic index. Adverse reactions can be encountered at dosages of around 250mg in most individuals. Side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Cardiac arrhythmias and seizures are possible at serum levels exceeding 20mg/ml. As with yohimbine, I believe exclusion of aminophylline from the injection solution will not largely affect the outcome of the mesotherapy treatment, but allows for a much safer approach to treatment.\n\n\\- Mesotherapy involves microinjections (2-12mm depth) of solution (0.1-0.3mL) into the subcutaneous tissue of the area(s) to be treated. Typically, treatments are performed weekly, bi-weekly or monthly depending on the area to be treated. \n\nFAQ\n\nQ) How the payment plan works? A) 5 sessions package - 2 division payments on 1 st and 3rd session 10 sessions package - 3 division payments on 1st, 3rd and 5th session \n\nQ) How many sessions do I need to have? A) It depends on patient body status but mostly effect will show after 5~8 sessions \n\nQ) How effective are injections? A) This injection is mainly targeted to dermal fat layer so has less effective result on losing weight but has desirable result on reducing fats on superficial layers but still result is not dramatic as surgical liposuction. \n\n\nSurgery time and",

Does it hurt?\n\n  * Unlike many cosmetic procedures requiring multiple sessions, Thermage FLX delivers results after a single treatment. Best of all, results continue to improve over time. \n  * The Thermage® FLX system incorporates vibration on the face and body treatments, which has been shown to help aid in patient comfort. You’ll feel a brief heating sensation when the treatment device’s tip touches your skin, followed by a cooling sensation to help protect your skin and minimize any discomfort. \n\n\n\nHow long will the results last?\n\nFor most patients, measurable results appear gradually in the two to six months following a single treatment session and can last for 1-2 years depending on your skin condition and aging process. \n\n* Recommended by physicians as part of an annual skin rejuvenation maintenance program. \n\nAre there common side effects?\n\nSome patients have temporary redness or minor swelling after treatment, but this usually goes away within 24 hours. \n\nHow long before I can get back to the work?\n\nMost patients return to their regular activities immediately following treatment. No special care is required afterward, aside from basic skin maintenance and broad-spectrum sunscreens as part of a regular skincare regimen. \n\nReal benefits of Thermage\n\n  * Multiple treatment areas\n  * Lasting Result\n  * Patient comfort\n  * Little to no downtime\n  * No surgery and No injections\n\n\n",

The range leverages the innovative preparations and high-tech agents developed in its laboratory. \n\n![Filorga](/data/editor/1903/6f641a3c30ec7c903f75e9fcb826ca8d_1551452770_9014.png)\n\nTHE MEDI-COSMETIQUE® REVOLUTION\n\n\"Beauty for all!\"\n\n\\- In 2007, France’s scientific research authority (CNRS) discovered a way of enabling active ingredient like NCTF® to be absorbed into the dermis without injection treatment. Driven by its CEO, Didier Tabary, FILORGA was able to make its anti-ageing expertise available to the general public: the result was MEDI-COSMETIQUE®, a range of products based on medical quality NCTF® and hyaluronic acid.\n\n\\- Over time, 58 cosmetic products were launched, all of which have the same objective: to deliver optimised, clinically proven effectiveness in a premiumpackaged product with a luxurious and sensory texture.\n\n![Filorga](/data/editor/1903/6f641a3c30ec7c903f75e9fcb826ca8d_1551452771_2966.png)\n\nFILORGA'S HYALURONIC ACID\n\n​\n\nAN INCOMPARABLE VOLUME-ENHANCING MOLECULE\n\n\\- Hyaluronic acid is a star line-filling molecule that is naturally present in the skin.\n\n\\- It plays an essential role in hydrating the skin and controlling aging.\n\n\\- However, hyaluronic acid diminishes over time (we lose 6% every 10 years), causing lines to appear and skin tone to slacken.\n\n\\- The molecular weight of our cosmetic hyaluronic acid product is similar to that of the injected product.

It is the result of tissue compression and skin elevation at the time of implanting the suture.\n\n\\- After inserting the suture, the doctor applies slight pressure on the treated area. In this way, the doctor reshapes the contours of your face and makes it visibly smoother.\n\n![Silhouette soft lifting image 3](/data/editor/1903/6f641a3c30ec7c903f75e9fcb826ca8d_1551450536_3912.png)\n\n\\- The regenerating effect is gradual: Poly L-lactic acid (PLLA), the principal component of Silhouette Soft® is a well-known polymer that has been used for many years in a number of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications: suture thread, orthopedic pins, rods, screws and nails for bone fractures. It is because this polymer shows excellent biocompatability and is biodegradable that such applications have been developed.\n\n\\- The small cones on the Silhouette Soft® Suture provide traction and fixation points, a natural foreign body reaction then reinforces this, by the build-up of new collagen formation.\n\n\\- This action is what helps restore shapeliness to the face and neck.\n\n![Silhouette soft lifting image 4](/data/editor/1903/6f641a3c30ec7c903f75e9fcb826ca8d_1551450536_8658.png)\n\nHow do you know Silhouette Soft® is safe?\n\nMade in the USA\n\n\\- Unlike many suspension sutures on the market today which originate from Asia, Silhouette Soft® is made in the USA and is subject to numerous sanitary controls.\n\n\\- Silhouette Soft® is made of a resorbable and biocompatible components, which has proven its worth in various medical fields: The main component of Silhouette Soft® – Poly L- lactic acid (or PLLA) – has been used for many years in vario",

Unlike traditional dermal fillers, which provide immediate results by adding volume, Sculptra works gradually to rebuild collagen, leading to long-lasting and natural-looking enhancements.\n\n### How Does Sculptra Work?\n\n**Collagen Stimulation** :Sculptra is injected into the deep layers of the skin, where it starts to stimulate the production of new collagen fibers. This process helps to restore lost volume and improve skin firmness over time.\n\nâ**Gradual Improvement** :Results from Sculptra develop progressively, with many patients seeing noticeable improvements after a few weeks. The full effects typically become apparent after a series of treatments, often spaced about 6-8 weeks apart.\n\nâ**Long-Lasting Results** :One of the standout features of Sculptra is its durability. The new collagen generated can last up to two years, offering a long-term solution for maintaining youthful skin.\n\n### **Benefits of Sculptra**\n\nâ¢ **Natural-Looking Enhancements** : Sculptra provides subtle, gradual results that enhance your natural appearance without the need for drastic changes.\n\nâ¢ **Non-Surgical Solution** : Enjoy the benefits of a non-invasive treatment that requires minimal downtime, allowing you to return to your daily activities almost immediately.\n\nâ¢ **Improved Skin Quality** : Beyond lifting and volumizing, Sculptra enhances skin texture and elasticity, addressing multiple signs of aging.\n\n### **How can I improve skin elasticity without undergoing surgery?**\n\nSkin elasticity can diminish with age, leading to sagging and a less firm appearance.

This non-surgical procedure involves the administration of deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. KybellaÂ® is particularly effective for those hard-to-shift pockets of fat that resist diet and exercise.\n\n### Benefits of KybellaÂ®\n\nPermanent Results: Once the fat cells are destroyed, they are gone for good, meaning KybellaÂ® provides permanent results.\n\nQuick Treatment: Each KybellaÂ® session takes approximately 20 minutes.\n\nMinimal Downtime: Most patients can return to their daily activities shortly after the treatment.\n\nCustomizable: KybellaÂ® can be tailored to target specific areas where you want to reduce fat.\n\n### **What to Expect**\n\nBefore Your Treatment: Before your KybellaÂ® treatment, you will have a consultation with one of our experienced injectors. During this session, we will discuss your goals, examine the areas of concern, and determine if Kybella is the right treatment for you.\n\n**The Treatment Process**\n\nPreparation: The targeted area is cleaned and marked for precise injection points.\n\nInjection: KybellaÂ® is injected into the fat beneath the skin. The number of injections depends on the amount of fat and the desired results.\n\nDuration: The entire process takes about 20 minutes.\n\n### **KybellaÂ® vs. Liposuction: Which is right for you?**\n\nBoth KybellaÂ® and liposuction are effective body fat reduction treatments, but they have distinct differences:\n\n**KybellaÂ® injections:**\n\nâ¢ Non-surgical: No incisions or anesthesia required.\n\nâ¢ Minimal downtime: Quick recovery, with most patients returning to daily activities immediately.\n\nâ¢ Perma",

This is more than just an event – it is a movement, a revolution, and a heartfelt celebration of the extraordinary women who shape, serve, and strengthen the aesthetic and beauty industries every day.\n\nAcross the globe, women are the powerhouse behind the aesthetic sector. In the UK alone, over 90% of the beauty and aesthetics workforce is female, with women leading the way in clinical practice, product innovation, patient care, and business development. From consultant surgeons to advanced aesthetic therapists, from anti-aging and wellness experts to business strategists, support services, and distributors, the landscape of aesthetics is rich with female talent, ambition, and ingenuity.\n\nWiA recognises that behind every successful clinic, every breakthrough treatment, and every glowing client, there is often a team of remarkable women making it all possible – not just as medical and allied healthcare professionals, but also as entrepreneurs, educators, scientists, and pioneers.\n\nThis inaugural gathering marks the beginning of a legacy. WiA is not simply about bringing women together in one room – it’s about creating lasting connections, lifting each other up, and forging a future where diverse female voices are not only heard but celebrated.\n\nWe welcome you to be part of this exciting first chapter – whether you’re a surgeon, a nurse, a formulator, a business founder, or the essential support that keeps everything running behind the scenes. Together, we are stronger. Together, we are WiA.\n\nWith gratitude and excitement,\n\n![](https://safetyinbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ANOTNIA-SAFETY-IN-BEAUTY-SIGNATURE-300x212.jpg",

    "full_content": "## How Does Emerald Laser™ Work?\n\nEmerald Laser™ works by emitting low-level green laser energy that targets and emulsifies fat cells beneath the skin. This advanced technology creates temporary pores in the fat cells, allowing the stored fat to be released and naturally processed by the body’s lymphatic system. This results in a slimmer, more contoured appearance without the need for surgery or downtime.\n\n## What is the Emerald Laser™ Treatment Like?\n\nDuring the Emerald Laser™ treatment, the laser is applied externally to the target area. The procedure is completely unattended, meaning it does not require constant supervision by a technician, enhancing convenience and comfort for patients. The low-level laser energy penetrates the skin and targets the fat cells without affecting the surrounding tissues. This makes the treatment safe and pain-free. The laser energy creates temporary pores in the fat cell membranes, causing the fat inside to be released. This process is called emulsification. Once released, the emulsified fat is then naturally processed and eliminated by the body’s lymphatic system.\n\n## What Results Can I Expect from Emerald Laser™?\n\nMost patients require a series of treatments with Emerald Laser™ to achieve optimal results. Each session is quick, typically lasting about 30 minutes, and there is no downtime, allowing you to resume your normal activities immediately after the treatment. Over the following weeks, the body continues to eliminate the fat, resulting in a noticeable reduction in fat deposits and a slimmer, more contoured appearance. On average, patients experience a circumference loss of about six inches.\n",

Prior to treatment, the skin may be numbed if desired to minimize any discomfort from the injection process. Then, the Jeuveau® formula will be injected into the area between the eyes, targeting the muscles responsible for glabellar lines. After the injections are performed, the treatment is complete. This process takes less than 30 minutes, making Jeuveau® a convenient treatment that can be performed on your lunch break.\n\n## What is Recovery Like After Jeuveau®?\n\nAfter Jeuveau®, you can expect some minor redness, swelling and sensitivity in the treatment area. However, these side effects typically resolve within a few days, and will not affect your usual activities.

As such, the cost of hormone replacement therapy will vary by patient, and cannot be specified until evaluating a patient’s needs. During your consultation, we will develop your personalized HRT treatment and provide you with detailed pricing information. **Before this visit, we ask that patients fill out the questionnaire below so that Dr. Hopkins can best understand and evaluate your needs.**\n\n[**Male Questionnaire**](https://www.hopkinsdermatology.com/wp-content/uploads/MaleHRTQuestionairre-1portrait.pdf)\n\n[**Female Questionnaire**](https://www.hopkinsdermatology.com/wp-content/uploads/FemaleHRTQuestionnaire-1portrait.pdf)\n\n## What are the Signs of a Hormonal Imbalance in Women?\n\nFor women, hormonal changes typically begin gradually during perimenopause. These changes will begin to accelerate with a significant dropoff during menopause. The most common symptoms during this time include:\n\n  * Hot flashes\n  * Changes in mood\n  * Irregular periods\n  * Poor memory and cognitive function\n  * Vaginal dryness and loss of libido\n  * Sleeping difficulties or insomnia\n\n\n\nWith HRT for women, which typically includes either progesterone and estrogen, but may also include testosterone, these symptoms can be managed and improved. Additionally, hormone replacement therapy can help reduce the risk of certain diseases and provide other health benefits.\n",

Collagen fibers are an important part of your skin, and when collagen production operates at a normal rate, the fibers develop in a structured pattern. In the case of a wound, though, the fibers develop quickly and without any clear pattern. Therefore, your scar has a different color and texture than the surrounding skin. Scar revision helps to blend the scar in with the natural color.\n",

However, achieving flawless skin and a glowing complexion is possible at any age. There are many great ways to reinvigorate skin that needs a bit of a pick-me-up, and one of the best methods is through a skin peel!\n\nA[ skin peel](https://www.askinclinic.co.uk/non-surgical-treatments/obagi-blue-radiance-skin-peel-belfast-northern-ireland-guernsey-jersey/) comes in many different forms and can work wonders. It’s ideal for those looking for a treatment that can reduce lines and wrinkles, as well as plump and restore the radiance in your skin. Peel Treatments are a great solution for the face, neck or hands. No needles, injections or surgical treatments are involved, making it an easy and painless way to achieve youthful skin.\n\n![](https://www.askinclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/glow1.jpg)\n\n**Fine Lines and Wrinkles**\n\nUnlike many laser treatments, a chemical peel is simply applied to the surface of the skin and works on dissolving dead skin cells using a variety of ingredients. The solution causes the initial surface of the skin to peel away and when the skin heals, the new cells produce healthier, tighter layers of skin. This is how a peel can work wonders on fine lines.\n\n[Wrinkles and fine lines](https://www.askinclinic.co.uk/2017/01/03/staying-wrinkle-free-get-rid-stubborn-lines/) are formed due to the rate of new cells being produced slowing down, with skin cells having 30% less moisture. The new skin cells that are produced from the peel create fresher tighter skin.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\n**Acne**\n\nPeels penetrate the surface layer of the skin, which a",

A healthy lifestyle—avoiding smoking, eating well, exercising, using sun protection, and following a skincare routine—helps maintain youthful skin. Additionally, several treatments can address age-related changes.____\n\n**Facial Rejuvenation** Dermal fillers restore lost volume, reducing wrinkles. Energy-based treatments boost collagen and tighten muscles. Peels and lasers repair sun damage, while injectables smooth wrinkles and lift brows for a refreshed look.____\n\n**Neck and Decolletage Care** Sun protection is essential. Profhilo and skin boosters improve texture and reduce lines, while resurfacing treatments fade pigmentation and tighten skin. Targeted injections dissolve fat under the chin for better jawline definition. Fractionated resurfacing, chemical peels, and light therapy can rejuvenate the chest area by reducing sunspots and broken capillaries.____\n\n**Hand and Arm Treatments** Hands show ageing early, so prevention is key—wear gloves, apply sun protection, and use hydrating creams. Skin booster injections restore volume, and lasers treat sunspots. For arms, maintaining muscle tone and a stable weight helps. Skin-tightening lasers and Profhilo can improve crepey skin.____\n\nFor tailored advice, the Aesthetic Skin Clinic offers consultations to provide treatments suited to your lifestyle. While ageing is inevitable, the right approach can slow its visible effects and even reverse some signs.____\n\nIf you would like further information on any of these treatments, please contact the Aesthetic Skin Clinic or book a consultation, where Hayley would be delighted to listen and talk through how aging is affecting you and how we might be able to help. It is always important to provide age-appropriate advice and treatment options that look natural and suit an individual’s lifestyle and needs.\n",

By altering the depth of the treatment, we can tailor the treatment around each case and every skin type, meaning Co2 is suitable for a wider range of patients and indications.\n\nThe SmartXIDE works by coagulating and removing columns of skin, encouraging new, healthier skin to surface. Within treatment, collagen is also stimulated, leading to tighter and firmer skin for at least 6 months post-treatment.\n\nNot only used for skin rejuvenating purposes, the SmartXIDE can help uniform uneven and multi-textured skin, as well as improving movement that is restricted by scar tissue and burns.\n\nLaser resurfacing should only be carried out by suitably qualified medical professionals who have a deep understanding of the technology and how to use it on different patients and for different skin conditions.\n\nIf you would like more information about this treatment click on the FAQ below or to arrange a consultation please contact our medical team.\n",

By preventing muscle contractions, this treatment helps smooth the skin, creating a more youthful and refreshed look.\n\nIt is also used medically to treat conditions like migraines, excessive sweating (known as [hyperhidrosis](https://www.askinclinic.co.uk/non-surgical-treatments/hyperhidrosis-treatment-with-botox/)[)](https://www.askinclinic.co.uk/non-surgical-treatments/hyperhidrosis-treatment-with-botox/) and muscle spasms.

Excess melanin is responsible for the darkened patches that appear on the skin’s surface, creating an uneven skin tone.\n\nHypopigmentation, is the absence of the required levels of melanin in the skin. This means that instead of darker patches on the skin, you start to see lighter skin blotches.\n\nSkin pigmentation may occur for various reasons and may be related to ageing, sun exposure, hormones and pregnancy. The formation of pigmentation on a cellular, microscopic level is complex and involves a number of processes. Treatment of your pigmentation will therefore involve a number of different modalities – and you will require a careful in-clinic consultation to determine the best treatment strategy. The Obagi skincare systems can provide medical strength topical agents to deal with hyperpigmentation but for the best results this will be combined with IPL Phototherapy, chemical peels and microdermabrasion\n\nAt the ASC we will assess your skin condition with the help of our Visia Skin analysis system to deliver a bespoke treatment plan for your condition.\n\nPhone or email now for further details or click on the links below for more information.\n",

This volume creates the apple cheeks we remember from years past. Non-surgical face lifting has been revolutionised in the past 5 years, with facial skin tightening devices and with injectable fillers that add volume back to the face.\n\n## A Range of Non-Surgical Facelift in Guernsey & Jersey\n\nWhile fat transfers to the face create the longest lasting volume replacement, there are many injectable treatments that do not require harvesting fat and a minor surgical procedure. To deliver the best results we combine Ultracel HIFU with volumising dermal filler like Voluma. Ultracel is the newest most effective facial tightening technology available, while Lanluma and Juvederm are both long lasting facial injectable treatments that require no surgery.\n\nThe synergistic effects of both treatments are amazing. Lanluma and Voluma help to add the volume back to the face that has deflated with age. Ultracel tightens but does not replenish the facial volume we lose as we age. An older face will show a loss of the fullness of the cheeks, temples, the lips and area around the mouth and will show fat loss under the eyes, which creates a hollow effect. Where there used to be light, now there are shadows. By replacing the volume loss, you reverse the creation of shadow and restore the reflection of light and the appearance of youth, energy and vibrance. When using Lanluma, this volume replacement fills the skin so that it is lifted by the formation of your body’s own collagen – collagen that was created in surrounding the microscopic particles that make up Lanluma.\n\nIntroducing a comprehensive range of non-surgical facelift techniques, the Aesthetic Skin Clinic can tailor the best treatments for your individual concerns.

The process, called photo rejuvenation, allows the light waves to target coloured particles such as haemoglobin in broken capillaries and melanin in sunspots and freckles.\n\nIPL improves the appearance of sun-damaged skin by removing age/sun spots, areas of hyperpigmentation and redness caused by broken vessels. IPL can be used on any isolated body areas such as the full face, the hands or décolletage.\n\nThe heat triggers an anti-inflammatory response in the tissues stimulating a collagen and elastin production, resulting in the skin not only appearing more even in tone but also firmer and smoother in texture.\n\nFor optimum results, most patients require 3 sessions at two weekly intervals. Before commencing treatment, patients will receive an in-depth skin assessment and consultation from one of our experienced medical practitioners.\n\nIf you would like more information about this treatment click on the FAQ below or to arrange a consultation please contact our medical team.\n",

He has altered the views of many skeptics, proving that non-surgical treatments can have equally effective results as surgical procedures. His world-famous Nefertiti Anti-Wrinkle Treatment® technique is just one example of his pioneering work, as it defines, re-contours and straightens the jawline.\n\nDiscovering the great power of dermal stem cells back in 2009, Dr Levy has identified and recreated the source of our skin’s own anti-wrinkle system, harnessing and reproducing those stem cells which are responsible for creating and maintaining the fibroblast-collagen-elastin matrix.\n\n## Unique Skin Stem Cell Products\n\nThe Aesthetic Skin Clinic supplies Dr Levy’s ingenious products at all of our locations. The skincare range contains Dr Levy’s patented ArganCellActiv® complex; a combination of ten potent anti-ageing and hydrating molecules. They exclusively contain Argan CDV, a stem cell derived from plants, which acts as an activator for our own natural wrinkle-defying cells in our skin. Based on the 2015 Nobel prize winning research, the new Décolletage regenerating silk, which combines two exclusive patented technologies, is a brand new addition to this iconic Stem cell range range.\n\nIts specially designed air tight bottles mean that the product inside is not compromised by air molecules, meaning you get the be",

    "full_content": "# Fraxel Skin Resurfacing in Guernsey\n\nFraxel is nothing like the laser facial-resurfacing treatments of yesteryear, which required three to four weeks of downtime hiding from your friends.\n\nFraxel works by causing controlled micro-injury to the skin, and the magic happens during the repair process. Instead of completely destroying the surface of the skin, what occurs with Fraxel is a pixilated-type destruction creating tiny micro-thermal zones. Those areas then stimulate new collagen production. Fraxel targets fine lines and enlarged pores, and can address some pigmentation issues, though there are lasers that are better at eradicating more stubborn dark spots.\n\nPenetrating deep into the dermis, the micro thermal zones eliminate old, pigmented epidermal (surface) cells, creating a controlled trauma to the skin. This triggers the body’s natural healing processes, improving the overall tone and texture of the skin, while targeting concerns such as scarring, laxity, facial lines and wrinkles. It has also been known to improve conditions such as melasma and surface pigmentation, as over time, healthy new rejuvenated luminous skin will reveal itself.\n\nThe Fraxel device can be used to treat the face, neck, décolleté, chin and top lip, as well as the chest and hands. It is clinically proven that each treatment session targets 15-20% of the skin’s surface in any one session, meaning successive treatment is required for optimum results. On average, patients will have 3-5 sessions, 28 days apart.\n\nFraxel is a powerful device that should only be carried out by a medical practitioner, to ensure the correct area is treated, at the correct levels and intensity. All patients at the Aesthetic Skin Clinic undergo a thorough medical consultation to outline concerns, discuss suitability and to receive their bespoke treatment programme.\n\nIf you would like more information about this treatment click on the FAQ below or to arrange a consultation please contact our medical team.\n",
