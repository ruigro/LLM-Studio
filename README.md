## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: After Cloning on a New PC**

**Model weight files are NOT included in Git due to their large size (1-50 GB each)!**

After cloning this repository, you **MUST** download model weights:

### Quick Check (Windows)
```cmd
check_models.bat
```

### Quick Check (Linux/Mac)
```bash
chmod +x check_models.sh
./check_models.sh
```

This will:

- ❌ List models that need downloading  
- 📋 Provide exact download instructions
